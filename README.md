# Logbook, Centre for Ecological Genetics

The intention of these pages is to create a more centralised collection of information specifically relating my own work within the Centre for Ecological Genetic (EcoGenetics). Hopefully this will serve as a useful reference not only for myself but also my collaborators within the centre.

## Sections

[Genomes](./genomes.md): Contains information about what genomic data is available for different species and potential notes about these. There is also listing several conventions used for structuring.
[Tasks](./tasks.md): List of tasked to be completed by me.
