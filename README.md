# Logbook, Centre for Ecological Genetics

The intention of these pages is to create a more centralised collection of information specifically relating my own work within the Centre for [Ecological Genetic (EcoGenetics)](https://github.com/EcologicalGenetics). Hopefully this will serve as a useful reference not only for myself but also my collaborators within the centre.

## Sections

- [Genomes](./genomes.md): Contains information about what genomic data is available for different species and potential notes about these. There is also listed several conventions used for structuring.
- [Tasks](./tasks.md): List of tasks to be completed by me.
- [Workflow Statements](./workflowStatements.md): Intended functionality of workflows and status on their current state.
